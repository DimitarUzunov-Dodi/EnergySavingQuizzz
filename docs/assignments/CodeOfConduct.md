# Code of Conduct 

In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary.


## Assignment description:
As a team, deliver a quiz game in the proposed timeframe using the required frameworks.

## Target or ambition level:
Every team member wishes to achieve a grade of 8 or higher in this course.

## Products:
The code will be delivered on GitLab, including documents. The relevant assignments will be submitted on brightspace. The code submitted must pass a set of TBD Checkstyle rules. The code shall have a reasonable line coverage in testing. 

To contribute in an organized manner, team members shall branch from 'develop'. Each issue shall have a single branch and work shall be committed only in that branch. After the issue is solved, pipelines passes and code achieves the quality standards detailed in this document, a merge request into 'develop' shall be created. After at least two other team members review the changes, the merge request shall be approved, merged and the source branch deleted. Each Sunday the code contributed by the team shall be merged into main. 


## Planning:
The team members will estimate how much each issue will take and work will be split equally among members. On Thursday, everyone will be available to help, so if someone falls behind on their schedule they can ask for help from other teammembers.

The team shall abide by 'Agile practices'. Each sprint shall be from Tuesday after the TA meeting until Sunday when is the deadline to merge everything into main. On Thursday we will have the stand-up meeting.

Each issue is a team member's own responsibility.

Pair programming may be used, but is discouraged for each team member's sake, due the way code contributions are counted in this course.

## Behavior: 
Team members are expected to treat eachother with respect. The way disagreements will be handled is clarified below. If someone is more than 5 minutes late, they shall bring something sweet, maybe cake, to the next meeting. The cake requirement is stackable.

## Communication:
The main platforms for communication are going to be Discord and Whatsapp. Team members are expected to be available on Thurdays from 10pm to 6pm to help other teammates. Helping is greatly encouraged! 

## Commitment:
Each piece of code merged must not fail the pipeline, must be reasonably tested and must pass Checkstyle.

The chairs must submit their agendas on time, and the minute takers should have at least one bullet point for each important matter discussed by the TA.

## Meetings:
We will meet each Tuesday before the TA meeting to have our sprint retrospective and planning. On Thursday we will be available the whole working day and we will update each other on progress or shortfalls.

## Decision-making:
Decisions are made with a through discussion about each side and then a consensus. If it is not reached then the TA shall be asked to help.

## Dealing with conflicts: 
Have a civilized discussion with each side explaining their points, if a consensus is not reached, ask a TA, if they cannot help, then a majority vote. If there is a draw decide using random chance.

## Guidance:
We expect guidance and feedback on collaboration and content, we expect help with organizatorial problems.

## Consequences:
Every teammate is expected to finish their issues on time. If they do not manage, next week they will still pick up new issues and be expected to finish the old ones. They will of course be given some leeway by getting easy issues.

## Succesfactors:
What makes your team a dream team?
* A collaborative spirit,
* Integrity
* Trust
* Commitment to the task at hand
* A drive to reach goals and achieve results.
