Ta meeting notes



We discussed during the stand up meeting that what we did during week 1 and the beginning of week 2. Alex forgot to send the backlog, but we still got some feedback. The ta gets the example backlog after the deadline. 

Backlog feedback:

Nice and specific. Work on priorities, can’t have as many must haves. Change to user stories. Make it with latex, although we don’t have to. 

I’m not writing down the stuff that we already have in the code of conduct.

Chairperson does the merging (?).

Once we have a better plan inform the TA.

Add labels.

Everybody has to have a merge request before Friday 6 pm.

Write more than one sentence for assignments like 1B. we should have linked the strengths to the actual roles for example. 

Code of conduct talk:

If we ever cannot reach a common consensus on a major problem then we are screwed. Flip a coin in this case. 

If any member is ever late to a meeting, that person has to bring food of a sweet kind. 

Next time, every time should contribute more during the TA meeting.
