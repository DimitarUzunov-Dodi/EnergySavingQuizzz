Backlog feedback

- admin -Q how should the admin interface work? - A (Waiting an answer.)

- question not being understandable - what does it mean for the question composition.

CoC feedback - no time for feedback

Endpoint  - sufficient - move the class in the API folder.

HCI feedback - really nice description
                - missing the images
                - no link
references - check HCI Rubik - all official external resources

HCI - maybe make the testers  look at it again for additional feedback, send to other teams, friends and specialists.

HCI "I will summarize" should be paraphrased  in to not so personal
 - issues should be connected to the heuristics 
 - add photos in Figma with the reworked product.

Agenda - important stuff should be before the more general stuff.

Teamwork - we should pick up the pace, and finish all the must-have this spring. We should do the work we have taken.

Waited for the official backlog. 

Small meeting with not all people participating, so we should try to finish the work on Thursdays.
Thursday should be much more consistent and productive. Currently, we are very slow and inefficient.
People should be more responsible with technical issues.

Sprint  Monday -> Sunday merge to main  on Sunday 23.59 (Do not merge 15 minutes before the deadline, because it can be slow.)

CoC update today.


Testing - JUnit and coverage , focus on JUnit, every method should be tested at least once.
!!EVERYTHING IN BACKHAND CAN BE TESTED!!

Little demo  each week to show products.

Check style - Q can we use the last years - A yes we can choose them.

LongBug - dependence, it can generate  test and setters
