# Notes

## Backlog feedback
* Official backlog - this week
* REALLY REALLY GOOD JOB ON BACKLOG	
Good gitlab work
# Discussing gitlab practises
## There is going to be a script report each meeting
*Script is run every Sunday at night
*Same contributions
*Equal merge request approval
*There should be meaningful comments in merge requests
## Recommended when approving a merge request:
*First pull changes
*Really check everything working
	**Tests
	**Codestyle
*Creator should response on comments to code
*Merge requests can be discussed during the meeting but there should be some activity on gitlab
*If merge request was approved by you, you are responsible for that code as well as creator
## Pipeline

Pipeline is installed on gitlab	
If pipeline is failing, you should fix it ASAP. First fix, then move to new stuff
## Code of Conduct feedback:

Be more specific in code of conduct. 
It should be clear from the CoC what project is about(More precise description of the app). 
Ambition level -> should mention learning goals.
CoC needs imporovment -> deadline - Friday (25.02)
Mention documents in ???
Maybe mention few more comments about test covering 
There will be more details about testing next week
Test coverage should be around 80% (recommended by a TA)
Planning: nice, missing how deadlines are going to be set?
Person responsible for submitting documents is not specified

### Few things are missing in behaviour 

More examples of disagreement and ways of solution of it - more details 
* How you can be more specific?
* How are you going to organise in discussion
* There should be few examples and ways of handling of those diagreements

Example : 

```
Person is not able to complete tasks on time
You disagree and state that it's manageable, how are you going to handle that? 
```

### Contribution
Add note how do you want to everybody contribute to project, extend to which you contribute
Example : 

```
HCI assignment, how do you expect everyone to contribute to it
Solution:
Everyone should work on every part
```

Commitment - really good job
Communication - is fine
Meetings - add purpose, small thing to add - how do you preapre for those meetings
Make sure everything is merged, have prepared, some scenarios when you dont need meetings ot extra meetings
	We agreed on working on Thursday -> everyone should be available, so we can organise it -> add it to CoC
Desicion making is ok
Something that everyone should respect things made in the group
Consequnces - good

## HCI assignment

Another HCI team
Discussing problems about another HCI team - they want to meet, but there is no need
No need to meet, no discord, only to give feedback
Alex opposed the idea of teamming up with team which is not really read the assignment
We kindly disappointed them with a strict rejection of the prosoal of teaming up

## API endpoints
We discussed -> everything should reate "Hello World" endpoint
It's required, at least one endpoint at the end of the week
On main by Sunday
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE - One of each type (mandatory is done)

## Plans for the nearest future

We should submit our endpint so far, and later we will start coding and add other code
If official backlog is not out yet, we should do architectural stuff
We will have endpoints, but until the of backlog is out we will make general code, and so, code base might be not that meaningful

If information literacy - friday assignment
Everyone has merge request - cool

## Deadlines
Endpoints - Sunday night
HCI - friday at 6
CoC - same
Agenda - Monday night
Teamwork assignment - friday 6 pm
