## Question round
* Still not clear why the pipeline fails for the activity bank merge request.
	- Natalia will ask the core staff.
* Any upcoming assignment?
	- Not really, just keep working.
* Where can we upload teamwork assignmets 5, 6 and so on?
	- The submissions will be opened on brightspace by the core staff.

## Closing remarks
* Continue working on the issues, in order of importance.
